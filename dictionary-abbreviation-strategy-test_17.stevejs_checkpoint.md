# Dictionary Abbreviation Strategy Test - Checkpoint

## Current Progress Summary

**CHECKPOINT STATUS**: Initial implementation complete, requires full-feature parity before final evaluation.

### Performance Results (Partial Implementation)
- **Manual Detector (FST)**: 103.2 MiB/s - Full feature support
- **Current DFA**: 181.8 MiB/s - Simple pattern only  
- **Dictionary Strategy**: 657.6 MiB/s - Simple pattern + abbreviation filtering

### Quality Results 
- **Abbreviations (9 cases)**: Dictionary 8/9 vs Production DFA 0/9
- **Dialog (5 cases)**: Manual 2/5, Dictionary 1/5, DFA 0/5

## Critical Finding: Feature Parity Gap

**PROBLEM**: Current dictionary strategy (657 MiB/s) only implements basic `[.!?]\s+[A-Z]` pattern, while manual detector (103 MiB/s) supports complex dialog and parenthetical patterns.

**COMPARISON IS NOT FAIR**: We're comparing simple regex performance against full FST functionality.

## Dialog Test Cases Requiring Review

The 5 dialog handling test cases currently used:

1. **Mixed abbreviation + dialog**: `"He said, 'Dr. Smith will see you.' She nodded."`
   - Expected: `["He said, 'Dr. Smith will see you.'", "She nodded."]`
   - Tests: Abbreviation + quote boundary + capital letter

2. **Quote-to-quote dialog**: `"'The U.S.A. is large,' he noted. 'Indeed,' she replied."`
   - Expected: `["'The U.S.A. is large,' he noted.", "'Indeed,' she replied."]`
   - Tests: Geographic abbreviation + quote boundaries

3. **Question in dialog**: `"John asked, 'Is Mr. Johnson here?' 'Yes,' came the reply."`
   - Expected: `["John asked, 'Is Mr. Johnson here?'", "'Yes,' came the reply."]`
   - Tests: Question mark + abbreviation + consecutive quotes

4. **Dialog attribution**: `"She whispered, 'Prof. Davis is strict.' The class fell silent."`
   - Expected: `["She whispered, 'Prof. Davis is strict.'", "The class fell silent."]`
   - Tests: Title abbreviation + dialog-to-narrative transition

5. **Time abbreviation in dialog**: `"'Meet me at 5 p.m. sharp,' he said. The appointment was set."`
   - Expected: `["'Meet me at 5 p.m. sharp,' he said.", "The appointment was set."]`
   - Tests: Time abbreviation + dialog attribution + narrative

**REVIEW NEEDED**: Are these representative of real dialog patterns in Project Gutenberg texts?

## Next Steps for Complete Evaluation

### Phase 1: Full Implementation
1. **Implement complete dictionary strategy** with proper dialog/parenthetical pattern support
2. **Ensure UTF-8 safety** for complex quote characters and multi-byte sequences
3. **Add parenthetical patterns**: Support for `". ("`, `". ["`, `". {"` boundaries

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing
1. **Process ALL ~20 Project Gutenberg texts** with each strategy:
   - Manual Detector (ground truth)
   - Current DFA (baseline)
   - Full Dictionary Strategy (candidate)

2. **Generate sentence files** for manual inspection:
   - `gutenberg_manual_sentences.txt`
   - `gutenberg_dfa_sentences.txt` 
   - `gutenberg_dictionary_sentences.txt`

3. **Quality analysis**:
   - Sentence count differences
   - Sample problematic cases
   - Abbreviation handling accuracy
   - Dialog boundary correctness

### Phase 3: Production Decision
1. **Performance vs Quality trade-off analysis**
2. **Edge case documentation**
3. **Implementation recommendations**

## Implementation Strategy for Full Dictionary Approach

```rust
// Patterns needed for parity with manual detector:
let dialog_patterns = [
    r"[.!?]\s+[A-Z]",                    // Basic: ". Capital"
    r#"[.!?]['"\u{201D}\u{2019}]\s+[A-Z]"#,  // Dialog end: ".' Capital" 
    r#"[.!?]\s+['"\u{201C}\u{2018}]"#,       // Quote start: ". 'Quote"
    r"[.!?]\s+[({\[]",                    // Parenthetical: ". (text"
];

// Phase 2: Abbreviation filtering on all matches
let abbreviations = ["Dr.", "Mr.", "Mrs.", "Prof.", "U.S.A.", "p.m.", ...];
```

## Current Limitations Requiring Fix

1. **UTF-8 character boundary errors** in complex pattern matching
2. **Incomplete dialog pattern coverage** vs manual detector
3. **Missing parenthetical support** entirely
4. **No smart quote handling** for UTF-8 quote characters

## Checkpoint Commit Justification

This checkpoint captures:
- ✅ Working basic dictionary implementation with 8/9 abbreviation accuracy
- ✅ Performance benchmark infrastructure for fair comparison
- ✅ Test harness for quality evaluation
- ❌ Incomplete feature parity (dialog/parentheticals)
- ❌ UTF-8 safety issues in enhanced patterns

**Next session focus**: Complete full-featured implementation and comprehensive Gutenberg text evaluation.
