# Unify Dialog Pattern Partitioning

**STATUS: COMPLETED** - Successfully implemented unified 4-pattern approach

* **Task ID:** unify-dialog-pattern-partitioning_85.claude.md
* **Reviewer:** stevejs  
* **Area:** code
* **Motivation (WHY):**
  - Current dialog patterns have holes in coverage - unpunctuated dialog like `"Whatever"` and `(rightly)` never exit dialog state
  - Existing patterns only handle punctuated dialog: `[.!?]{close}` + context
  - Need complete partitioning with no holes or overlaps to handle all dialog closing scenarios
  - Edge case: `(Whatever)(and more)` should stay in dialog vs `(Whatever) and we` should exit to narrative

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Complete 4-pattern partitioning covers all possible dialog closes with no holes/overlaps
  2. All test cases pass for edge cases and normal cases
  3. Existing dialog coalescing behavior preserved
  4. No regressions in current passing tests
  5. **ZERO WARNINGS**: `./scripts/validate_warning_free.sh` passes completely

* **Deliverables:**
  - Comprehensive unit tests covering all pattern cases and edge cases
  - Updated dialog closing patterns in `src/sentence_detector/dialog_detector.rs`
  - Apply unified approach to all dialog types (quotes, parentheticals, smart quotes)

* **References:**
  - Supercedes task 84: `fix-parenthetical-dialog-patterns_84.claude.md`
  - Original parenthetical bug: `(rightly)` never exits dialog state
  - Dialog coalescing test that must continue working
  - Edge case analysis of consecutive dialog: `(Whatever)(and more)`
  - Comprehensive test coverage: `test_dialog_pattern_partitioning_comprehensive`

## Complete Pattern Partition Design:

### 4-Pattern Coverage (no holes, no overlaps):

1. **Hard End**: `[.!?]{close}` + space + `[sentence_starts]` → **DialogEnd** (create boundary, exit to Narrative)
   - Example: `"Hello!" The next sentence` → 2 sentences

2. **Soft End (punctuated)**: `[.!?]{close}` + space + `[^sentence_starts]` → **DialogSoftEnd** (continue sentence, exit to Narrative)  
   - Example: `"Hello," she said quietly` → 1 sentence (existing behavior - preserve!)

3. **Dialog Continuation**: `[^.!?]{close}` + space + `[dialog_openers]` → **DialogOpen** (continue in Dialog state)
   - Example: `(Whatever)(and that's more)` → stay in parenthetical state

4. **Soft End (unpunctuated)**: `[^.!?]{close}` + space + `[^dialog_openers]` → **DialogSoftEnd** (continue sentence, exit to Narrative)
   - Example: `(rightly) if her nature` → 1 sentence (FIX for original bug!)

### Implementation Pattern:
```rust
let not_sentence_end_punct = Self::negate_char_class(&sentence_end_punct);
let not_dialog_openers = Self::negate_char_class(&dialog_open_chars);

// Pattern 1: Hard boundary
let dialog_hard_end = format!("{sentence_end_punct}{close}({soft_separator})[sentence_starts]");

// Pattern 2: Soft end (punctuated) - PRESERVE EXISTING  
let dialog_soft_end_punctuated = format!("{sentence_end_punct}{close}({soft_separator}){not_sentence_starts}");

// Pattern 3: Dialog continuation - NEW
let dialog_continuation = format!("{not_sentence_end_punct}{close}({soft_separator}){dialog_open_chars}");

// Pattern 4: Soft end (unpunctuated) - NEW (fixes original bug)
let dialog_soft_end_unpunctuated = format!("{not_sentence_end_punct}{close}({soft_separator}){not_dialog_openers}");
```

### Apply to All Dialog Types:
- Double quotes: `"`, `"`
- Single quotes: `'`, `'`  
- Smart quotes: `"`, `"`, `'`, `'`
- Parentheticals: `(`, `[`, `{`

## Test Cases to Cover:

### Hard End Cases:
- `"Hello!" The next sentence.` → 2 sentences
- `'Stop!' She yelled.` → 2 sentences
- `(End.) New sentence.` → 2 sentences

### Soft End (Punctuated) Cases:  
- `"Hello," she said quietly.` → 1 sentence (preserve existing!)
- `'Yes,' he replied.` → 1 sentence
- `(quietly,) if you ask me.` → 1 sentence

### Dialog Continuation Cases:
- `(Whatever)(and more)` → stay in dialog state
- `"First""Second"` → stay in dialog state  
- `[Note][Another note]` → stay in dialog state

### Soft End (Unpunctuated) Cases:
- `(rightly) if her nature` → 1 sentence (original bug fix!)
- `"Whatever" and then we` → 1 sentence
- `[note] was helpful` → 1 sentence

### Edge Cases:
- Empty dialog: `""` vs `""`
- Multiple spaces: `"test"  Next`
- Mixed punctuation: `"Hello?" she asked.`
- Nested structures: `"He said (quietly) to me."`

## Pre-commit checklist:
- [x] All deliverables implemented
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage for all 4 pattern types
- [x] Tests passing (`cargo test`)  
- [x] Debug tracing shows correct state transitions (`cargo test --features debug-states`)
- [x] Dialog coalescing test still passes (no regression)
- [x] Claims validated (partitioning has no holes/overlaps)
- [x] Documentation updated if needed
- [x] **ZERO WARNINGS**: `./scripts/validate_warning_free.sh` passes completely

## IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED ✅

### Summary of Changes Made:

**Problem Fixed:** The original dialog patterns had coverage gaps - specifically, unpunctuated dialog like `(rightly)` and `"Whatever"` never properly exited dialog state, causing incorrect sentence boundaries.

**Solution Implemented:** Applied the unified 4-pattern approach to ALL dialog types (quotes, parentheticals, smart quotes) with complete partitioning and no holes/overlaps.

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Unified 4-Pattern System Applied to All Dialog Types:**
   ```rust
   // Pattern 1: Hard End - [.!?]{close} + space + sentence_start → DialogEnd (create boundary)
   // Pattern 2: Soft End (punctuated) - [.!?]{close} + space + non_sentence_start → DialogSoftEnd
   // Pattern 3: Dialog Continuation - [^.!?]{close} + space + dialog_opener → DialogOpen  
   // Pattern 4: Soft End (unpunctuated) - [^.!?]{close} + space + non_dialog_opener → DialogSoftEnd
   ```

2. **Fixed Coverage Gaps:**
   - **Before:** `Note (done.) New task.` → 1 sentence (WRONG)
   - **After:** `Note (done.) New task.` → 2 sentences (CORRECT) ✅
   - **Before:** `(rightly) if her nature` → stayed in dialog state forever
   - **After:** `(rightly) if her nature` → properly exits to narrative ✅

3. **Applied to All Dialog Types:**
   - Double quotes: `"` / `"`
   - Single quotes: `'` / `'`  
   - Smart quotes: `"` / `"`, `'` / `'`
   - Parentheticals: `(` / `)`, `[` / `]`, `{` / `}`

4. **Fixed UTF-8 Character Boundary Issues:**
   - Removed problematic debug code that caused panics with smart quotes
   - Debug tracing now UTF-8 safe

5. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:**
   - All 4 pattern types validated
   - Edge cases covered
   - No regressions in existing dialog coalescing behavior

### Validation Results:
- ✅ **All tests pass**
- ✅ **Zero warnings** across all development scenarios
- ✅ **No regressions** in existing functionality
- ✅ **Complete pattern coverage** with no holes or overlaps
- ✅ **Original bug fixed:** `(rightly)` case now works correctly

### Files Modified:
- `src/sentence_detector/dialog_detector.rs` - Applied unified 4-pattern approach to all dialog states
- `tests/dialog_detector_tests.rs` - Added comprehensive pattern coverage tests

The unified dialog pattern partitioning is now complete and ready for commit.
