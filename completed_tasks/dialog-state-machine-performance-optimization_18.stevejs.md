# Dialog State Machine Performance Optimization

* **Task ID:** dialog-state-machine-performance-optimization_18.stevejs
* **Reviewer:** stevejs
* **Area:** code
* **Motivation (WHY):**
  - Dialog state machine shows 99.9% performance regression (0.1 MiB/s vs 181 MiB/s baseline)
  - Implementation violates O(1) performance with O(N) position conversions on every sentence
  - Type-safe position wrappers cause O(N²) behavior due to scanning from text start
  - Multiple character iterations and string allocations add unnecessary overhead
  - Need incremental optimization with benchmarking to identify performance gains per fix

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Four separate optimization phases with individual commits and benchmarks
  2. Each phase improves dialog state machine throughput measurably
  3. Final implementation achieves competitive performance (>50 MiB/s target)
  4. All existing 5/5 test scenarios continue to pass after each phase
  5. Clear performance attribution per optimization with commit history

* **Optimization Phases:**

## Phase 1: Incremental Position Tracking
**Target**: Fix O(N²) → O(N) by maintaining incremental counters instead of scanning from text start

**Changes**:
- Add `PositionTracker` struct with incremental `byte_pos`, `char_pos`, `line`, `col` counters
- Replace `byte_to_char_pos(text, pos)` calls with `tracker.advance_to_byte(pos)`
- Replace `char_to_line_col(text, pos)` calls with `tracker.get_line_col()`
- Maintain single forward-only scan instead of repeated scans from beginning

**Expected Gain**: 10-100x improvement (eliminate O(N²) bottleneck)
**Commit**: feat: implement incremental position tracking for dialog state machine (see tasks/dialog-state-machine-performance-optimization_18.stevejs.md)

## Phase 2: Deferred Position Conversion
**Target**: Defer expensive position conversions until final output

**Changes**:
- Perform all boundary detection using byte positions only
- Store sentences as `(start_byte, end_byte, content)` during detection loop
- Convert to line/col positions in final pass after all sentences detected
- Single UTF-8 scan for all position conversions at end

**Expected Gain**: 2-5x improvement (reduce conversion frequency)
**Commit**: feat: defer position conversions until final output for dialog state machine (see tasks/dialog-state-machine-performance-optimization_18.stevejs.md)

## Phase 3: Single Character Scan Optimization
**Target**: Eliminate multiple character iterations in classify_match

**Changes**:
- Replace multiple `.chars().any()` calls with single character scan
- Combine punctuation, letter, and whitespace detection in one pass
- Use byte-level checks where possible for ASCII characters
- Cache character classification results within match

**Expected Gain**: 20-50% improvement (reduce character iteration overhead)
**Commit**: feat: optimize character scanning in dialog state machine classify_match (see tasks/dialog-state-machine-performance-optimization_18.stevejs.md)

## Phase 4: Memory Allocation Reduction
**Target**: Minimize string allocations during detection loop

**Changes**:
- Avoid `.to_string()` calls during detection (use string slices)
- Defer content string creation until final sentence construction
- Reuse string buffers where possible
- Use `Cow<str>` for conditional string allocation

**Expected Gain**: 10-20% improvement (reduce allocation overhead)
**Commit**: feat: reduce memory allocations in dialog state machine detection loop (see tasks/dialog-state-machine-performance-optimization_18.stevejs.md)

* **Benchmarking Strategy:**
  - Run `GUTENBERG_MIRROR_DIR=~/gutenberg_texts cargo bench -- dialog_state_machine_chars_per_sec` after each phase
  - Compare against current baseline: ~0.1 MiB/s (timeout after 824s for 100 samples)
  - Target progression: 0.1 → 10 → 50 → 100 → 150+ MiB/s
  - Ensure 5/5 test scenarios pass after each phase
  - Document performance gains in commit messages

* **Implementation Approach:**
  - Make changes directly to `/tests/dialog_state_machine_exploration.rs`
  - Add phase-specific comments with `// PHASE N:` markers
  - Keep all existing functionality while optimizing implementation
  - Validate against test scenarios after each phase
  - Create separate commit for each phase with benchmark results

* **Deliverables:**
  - **Phase 1**: Incremental position tracking implementation + benchmark results + commit
  - **Phase 2**: Deferred conversion implementation + benchmark results + commit
  - **Phase 3**: Single character scan optimization + benchmark results + commit
  - **Phase 4**: Memory allocation reduction + benchmark results + commit
  - **Performance analysis**: Throughput improvement attribution per phase
  - **Final benchmark**: Competitive performance vs other strategies

* **Success Criteria:**
  - Dialog state machine achieves >50 MiB/s throughput (competitive with context analysis: 229 MiB/s)
  - All 5/5 test scenarios continue to pass after each phase
  - Clear performance progression documented through commit history
  - Implementation maintains type safety and correctness

* **Risk Mitigation:**
  - Test scenarios validate correctness after each phase
  - Incremental approach allows rollback if phase causes regression
  - Benchmark validation ensures actual performance gains
  - Type safety preserved through incremental counter design
