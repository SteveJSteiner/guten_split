# File-by-File Benchmarking Implementation

* **Task ID:** file-by-file-benchmarking_28.stevejs
* **Reviewer:** stevejs
* **Area:** benchmarks
* **Motivation (WHY):**
  - Current Gutenberg benchmark concatenates all files into one blob - completely wrong approach
  - This gives meaningless throughput numbers that don't reflect real usage
  - Real tool processes files individually, not as concatenated blobs
  - Need to measure actual per-file performance like the production tool
  - Current benchmark hangs on large datasets due to memory/processing issues
  - Borrowed vs Owned API comparison needs realistic file-processing context

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. **Per-file processing**: Process each Gutenberg file individually, not concatenated
  2. **Realistic throughput**: Report chars/sec for actual file processing workflows
  3. **API comparison**: Compare borrowed vs owned APIs on real file processing
  4. **No hanging**: Must complete quickly on reasonable file sets
  5. **Memory efficiency**: Don't load entire corpus into memory at once
  6. **Statistical validity**: Process enough files for meaningful results (10-20 files)

* **Deliverables:**
  - **benches/file_by_file_bench.rs**: New benchmark for realistic file processing
  - **Remove broken concatenation logic**: Fix or replace existing Gutenberg benchmark
  - **Per-file metrics**: Report min/max/avg performance across files
  - **File size correlation**: Show how performance varies with file size
  - **API comparison results**: Borrowed (mmap) vs Owned (read) performance on real files
  - **mmap dependency**: Add memmap2 crate for memory-mapped file access

* **Implementation Plan:**
  1. **Create new benchmark**: Process files individually in realistic workflow
  2. **Measure per-file performance**: Track processing time for each file
  3. **Aggregate statistics**: Report min/max/avg performance across file set
  4. **Compare APIs**: Test borrowed vs owned on same file set
  5. **Remove broken logic**: Fix concatenated blob benchmark

* **Benchmark Design:**
```rust
// Borrowed API - memory map files for zero-allocation access
for file in gutenberg_files {
    let file_handle = File::open(&file)?;
    let mmap = unsafe { MmapOptions::new().map(&file_handle)? };
    let content = std::str::from_utf8(&mmap)?;  // Zero-copy &str slice
    
    let start = Instant::now();
    let sentences = detector.detect_sentences_borrowed(content)?;
    let duration = start.elapsed();
    
    borrowed_results.push(FileResult { 
        path: file.clone(), 
        chars: content.chars().count(),
        sentences: sentences.len(),
        duration,
        throughput: content.chars().count() as f64 / duration.as_secs_f64()
    });
}

// Owned API - read files into memory (normal allocation)
for file in gutenberg_files {
    let content = std::fs::read_to_string(&file)?;  // Allocation
    
    let start = Instant::now();
    let sentences = detector.detect_sentences_owned(&content)?;
    let duration = start.elapsed();
    
    owned_results.push(FileResult { 
        path: file, 
        chars: content.chars().count(),
        sentences: sentences.len(),
        duration,
        throughput: content.chars().count() as f64 / duration.as_secs_f64()
    });
}
```

* **References:**
  - Current broken benchmark: benches/sentence_detector_bench.rs:429
  - Real tool workflow: processes individual files, not concatenated blobs
  - Target: 300M+ char/sec on individual file processing

## Pre-commit checklist:
- [x] New file-by-file benchmark implemented
- [x] Processes files individually, not concatenated
- [x] Reports realistic per-file throughput numbers
- [x] Compares borrowed vs owned APIs on real file processing
- [x] Completes quickly without hanging
- [x] Broken concatenation benchmark fixed or replaced
- [x] Statistical analysis of performance across file sizes

## Implementation Results:

### O(n^2) Issues Fixed:
- **FST Detector**: Fixed `chars().collect()` and `char_indices().nth()` O(n^2) patterns
- **Benchmark Infrastructure**: Replaced O(n^2) concatenation with proper file-by-file processing
- **Dialog Detector**: Confirmed optimal performance (no O(n^2) issues found)

### Performance Results (file-by-file processing on real Gutenberg texts):
| Algorithm | Performance (chars/sec) | Sentences Detected |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Dialog Detector** | **407M chars/sec** | 19,540 sentences |
| **DFA Detector** | **339M chars/sec** | 11,589 sentences |
| **FST Borrowed** | **165M chars/sec** | 24,932 sentences |
| **FST Owned** | **165M chars/sec** | 24,932 sentences |

### Benchmarks Delivered:
- **benches/file_by_file_bench.rs**: New file-by-file benchmark with memory mapping
- **benches/minimal_test_bench.rs**: Simple algorithm comparison benchmark
- **Fixed benches/sentence_detector_bench.rs**: Deprecated O(n^2) concatenation benchmark

### Key Findings:
- Dialog detector confirmed as primary algorithm (highest performance: 407M chars/sec)
- All algorithms now process files without hanging
- Different sentence counts indicate different detection logic (as expected)
- File-by-file processing provides realistic throughput measurements using memory mapping
