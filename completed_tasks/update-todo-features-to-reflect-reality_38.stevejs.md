# Update TODO_FEATURES.md to Reflect Reality

* **Task ID:** update-todo-features-to-reflect-reality_38.stevejs.md
* **Reviewer:** stevejs
* **Area:** docs
* **Motivation (WHY):**
  - Assessment found 75% of TODO_FEATURES items are actually COMPLETE
  - High-priority items describe missing features that exist (abbreviations, mmap, multi-pattern DFA)
  - Planning based on outdated assumptions prevents accurate prioritization
  - Need accurate current state for future development decisions

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Mark completed features as COMPLETED in TODO_FEATURES.md
  2. Move completed items to archived section
  3. Update context/descriptions to reflect actual implementation state
  4. Identify genuinely remaining work vs outdated assumptions
  5. Re-prioritize remaining items based on actual needs

* **Deliverables:**
  - Updated TODO_FEATURES.md with accurate completion status
  - Archived section for completed features
  - Accurate remaining backlog reflecting real current state
  - Updated effort estimates based on actual implementation

* **References:**
  - comprehensive-implementation-reality-check_36.stevejs.md findings
  - Assessment FINDING 5: 4+ major features marked TODO are actually COMPLETE

## Specific Items to Update:
- [ ] "Complete sentence boundary rules implementation" → COMPLETED (abbreviations work perfectly)
- [ ] "Multi-pattern DFA with PatternID" → COMPLETED (HashMap<DialogState, Regex> exists)
- [ ] "Memory-mapped file processing" → COMPLETED (detect_sentences_borrowed API)
- [ ] "3-char lookbehind abbreviation checking" → COMPLETED (AbbreviationChecker exists)

## Pre-commit checklist:
- [ ] All completed features marked as COMPLETED
- [ ] Outdated descriptions updated to reflect reality
- [ ] Remaining backlog accurately reflects actual missing features
- [ ] Archive section created for completed work
- [ ] Priority reassessment based on real current state
