# Project Rename Before Publishing

* **Task ID:** project-rename-before-publishing_37.stevejs.md
* **Reviewer:** stevejs
* **Area:** docs
* **Motivation (WHY):**
  - Current name "guten_split" doesn't reflect actual purpose (sentence extraction)
  - Zero technical dependencies - can be done immediately
  - Essential before any external sharing/publishing of the work
  - Prevents future complications from renaming after sharing

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Choose appropriate name reflecting sentence extraction purpose
  2. Update Cargo.toml package name and metadata
  3. Update all README/documentation references
  4. Update repository name if applicable
  5. Verify project builds and tests pass with new name

* **Deliverables:**
  - Updated Cargo.toml with new project name
  - Updated documentation references
  - Verified clean build with new name

* **References:**
  - Assessment finding: Project rename has zero dependencies and immediate impact
  - TODO_FEATURES.md process improvement (still valid)

## Pre-commit checklist:
- [x] New project name chosen and validated (seams)
- [x] Cargo.toml updated with new name
- [x] Documentation updated with new references (PRD.md updated)
- [x] Clean build verified (`cargo test`)
- [x] Repository name updated if applicable (deferred - directory name doesn't affect functionality)

## COMPLETION NOTES
**Date:** 2025-07-06
**New Name:** `seams`
**Reason:** (see naming/ directory)
