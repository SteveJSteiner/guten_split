# Evaluate Restart Checkpointing Necessity

* **Task ID:** restart-checkpointing-evaluation_77.stevejs
* **Reviewer:** stevejs
* **Area:** code
* **Motivation (WHY):**
  - Current throughput of 1GB/sec may make restart checkpointing unnecessary complexity
  - Simplifying the codebase could improve maintainability and reduce edge cases
  - Need to evaluate whether processing speed eliminates the need for incremental processing
  - Consider different corpus sizes and processing scenarios
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Benchmark processing times for various corpus sizes (1GB, 10GB, 100GB)
  2. Calculate time savings of restart vs. reprocessing from scratch
  3. Evaluate complexity cost of maintaining restart logic
  4. Consider different failure scenarios and recovery needs
  5. Make recommendation: keep, simplify, or remove restart functionality
* **Deliverables:**
  - Performance analysis document with benchmark results
  - Complexity analysis of current restart implementation
  - Cost-benefit analysis of restart vs. reprocessing
  - Recommendation with rationale
  - If removal recommended: implementation plan for cleanup
* **References:**
  - Current restart_log module implementation
  - Processing performance of 1GB/sec
  - Discussion of >hour processing scenarios
