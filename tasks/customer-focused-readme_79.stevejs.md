# Customer-Focused README Take 2

* **Task ID:** customer-focused-readme_79.stevejs
* **Reviewer:** stevejs
* **Area:** docs
* **Motivation (WHY):**
  - Current README is too long and developer-focused for end users
  - Need concise, customer-focused documentation for crates.io publication
  - Target literary researchers and digital humanities users, not developers
  - First impression determines adoption - must be immediately clear and compelling
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Concise README focused on user value, not implementation details
  2. Clear 30-second pitch: what it does, why it's useful, how to get started
  3. Minimal installation and usage examples that work immediately
  4. Remove or minimize technical implementation details
  5. Focus on literary research use cases and benefits
  6. Professional but approachable tone for academic users
* **Deliverables:**
  - Rewritten README.md with customer focus
  - Clear value proposition for literary researchers
  - Simple installation and first-use workflow
  - Concise examples showing immediate utility
  - Removal of excessive technical detail
* **References:**
  - Current README.md (too long and technical)
  - PRD Section 13.3 CLI-First User Experience requirements
  - Target audience: literary researchers, digital humanities scholars
  - Similar successful CLI tools' README structure
