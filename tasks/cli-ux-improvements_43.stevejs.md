# CLI User Experience Improvements

* **Task ID:** cli-ux-improvements_43.stevejs
* **Reviewer:** stevejs  
* **Area:** code
* **Motivation (WHY):**
  - PRD Section 13.3 requires CLI-first user experience for open source publication
  - Target audience (narrative analysis pipeline builders) needs hassle-free installation and usage
  - Current CLI lacks comprehensive help, error messaging, and installation convenience
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Unit tests pass (`cargo test`)
  2. `seams --help` provides comprehensive usage examples
  3. Error messages include actionable suggestions for common failures
  4. Shell completion works for bash/zsh/fish
  5. Installation via `cargo install seams` works smoothly
  6. Progress output works well in both interactive and CI/pipeline contexts
* **Deliverables:**
  - Enhanced clap CLI configuration with examples and better help text
  - Improved error handling with actionable error messages
  - Shell completion generation support
  - Installation documentation and verification
  - Progress bar behavior suitable for both interactive and automated usage
* **References:**
  - PRD Section 13.3 CLI-First User Experience requirements
  - PRD Section 7 CLI & Config existing specifications
