1. [90] society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.

2. [127] “It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.

3. [251] But may we not hope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters?

4. [3] Mr.

5. [47] Bingley will not be detained in London by them.

6. [93] ” “Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter.

7. [22] I will read it to you.

8. [398] “‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel.

9. [175] Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I despair.

10. [230] I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.

11. [79] ’ “It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this winter.

12. [66] ” “It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.

13. [25] ” “Why will you think so?

14. [47] It must be his own doing; he is his own master.

15. [26] But you do not know _all_.

16. [58] I _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me.

17. [35] I will have no reserves from _you_.

18. [4] ‘Mr.

19. [111] Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again.

20. [268] I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister.

21. [189] I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable.

22. [300] My brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman’s heart.

23. [187] With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?

24. [83] ’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said Jane, as she finished it.

25. [24] “Is it not clear enough?

26. [261] Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard.

27. [46] Can there be any other opinion on the subject?

28. [49] ” “Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.

29. [17] Will you hear it?

30. [18] ” “Most willingly.

31. [36] ” “You shall have it in a few words.

32. [89] Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy.

33. [116] She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.

34. [22] ” Jane shook her head.

35. [39] “Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.

36. [124] No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she is not such a simpleton.

37. [44] Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.

38. [62] Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes.

39. [361] But the case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.

40. [359] But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.

41. [113] ” “If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your representation of all this might make me quite easy.

42. [36] But I know the foundation is unjust.

43. [70] Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can
