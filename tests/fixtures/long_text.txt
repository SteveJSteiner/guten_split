This is a long text file for testing the sentence detection throughput. It contains many sentences. The purpose of this file is to provide a realistic workload for the benchmark. We need to see how the sentence detector performs on a large amount of text. This will help us to identify any performance bottlenecks and to ensure that the detector can scale to handle large inputs. We will repeat this sentence multiple times to make the file long.
